    <h3>Dear Hubby</h3>
    <h5>lyrics</h5>
    <p>
        Dear Hubby, I just want to say,<br>
        I am so grateful you came my way. <br>
        Through every trial you come with me <br>
        remind me that storms don't stay.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        You stand so strong, you hold the light<br>
        Through every season, through every climb<br>
        Your faith is steady, your heart is true<br>
        I'm blessed to walk this journey with you.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        You see the light and skies turns gray<br>
        You find the good in every day<br>
        You keep us moving step by step<br>
        With love so deep and ---that our hearts crept--- <br>
        To every sunset, to every day<br>
        Forever and always, I'm yours to stay.<br>
    </p>
    <p>..Music..</p>
    <p>
        ---so kind
        The heart like yours is hard to find <br>
        To every gift, to every prayer <br>
        You show the love, it's always there <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        You see the light and skies turns gray<br>
        You find the good in every day<br>
        You keep us moving step by step<br>
        With love so deep and ---that our hearts crept--- <br>
        To every sunset, to every day<br>
        Forever and always, I'm yours to stay.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        No mountains too high, no valley too low <br>
        With you beside, my love will grow <br>
        Hand-in-hand we'll face the tide <br>
        With faith in love right by our side <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        You see the light and skies turns gray<br>
        You find the good in every day<br>
        You keep us moving step by step<br>
        With love so deep and ---that our hearts crept--- <br>
        To every sunset, to every day<br>
        Forever and always, I'm yours to stay.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        So, happy Valentine's Day to you <br>
        My love, my heart, my soul so true <br>
        Forever and always, through thick and thin <br>
        I choose You now, I choose You again <br>
        Forever and always, my love, best friend <br>
        I choose You now, I choose You again <br>
    </p>
