        <p>Akshay Tritiya is an auspicious occasion. Akshaya Tritiya, also known as Akha Teej, is celebrated by Hindus and Jains as a day that brings unending prosperity and blessings. The word Akshaya means "never diminishing", and itâ€™s considered highly auspicious for starting new ventures, making charitable donations, or investing in gold and property.
